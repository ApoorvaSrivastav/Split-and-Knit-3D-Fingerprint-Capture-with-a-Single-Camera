The folder contains the code for Split and Knit algorithm. The code is a MATLAB pipeline. The code covers the complete pipeline from mask generation to 3D fingerprint knitting.

Some blocks of the code is taken from the publically available online sources:
1) We would like to thank xiumingzhang Surface Normal reconstruction part of the Photometric Stereo is taken from https://github.com/xiumingzhang/photometric-stereo
2) We would like to thank Dr. Peter Kovesi for multiple image processing MATLAB functions like Frankot-Chellappa reconstruction, Shapelet reconstruction, 2D fingerprint matching pipelines etc. All these are present at
